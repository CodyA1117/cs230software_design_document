Draw It or Lose It - Project Readme

Executive Summary:

I am Cody Adams, and this document shows the design implementation of a web based gaming application called "Draw it or Lose It".  The ultimate goal when creating this game
was to make a gaming experience that was maintainable, scalable, and efficient. We leveraged object oriented principles, and we aimed to deliver a robust, and clean codebase for 
a great gaming experience.


Design Constraints:
We had some challenges when working on this project.  Some of those challenges included scalability, maintainability, security, compatability, and performance. To address the scalability problem, we would implement efficent data management, and
distributed processing.
